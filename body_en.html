					In the beginning, I want to say why the analysis is presented here only for Russia and only briefly
					mentioned other countries, like Mongolia or Thailand. This is because I can only speak responsibly
					about what I know. I do not know the state of affairs in other countries. I do not know what
					administrative actions were taken there. I don't know what vaccines were used there. <br />
					Only domestic vaccines are used in Russia. Sputnik-5 is mainly used here. In other countries, other
					vaccines are used. Therefore, it is impossible to directly transfer the experience of Russia to
					other countries.<br />
					It will be interesting for all of us if residents of other countries describe, on the basis of
					statistical and historical data, how the pandemic went there. It will be interesting to see the
					comparisons visually.
					I also want to clarify that the "Case fatality rate" is almost meaningless to count day by day. This
					makes sense only under rather rare conditions, when the mortality and morbidity graphs are
					horizontal for a long time. In general, the "Case fatality rate" should be calculated for at least
					monthly time intervals.

			<h3>Statistical anomalies of the COVID epidemic in Russia.</h3>

			<div class="page_block">
				<p class="text-start">
					1. There are two kinds of waves - light and heavy. In a light wave, deaths and cases are
					low, but
					the waveform is sinusoid, with a mild inflexion and a continuous plateau at the maximum.
					In
					a heavy wave, deaths and cases are high, and the graph is triangular, when
					in the beginning
					there is a linear rise, a sudden break and a linear drop.
					<br />
					<br />
					In Russia, from July to October there are two contradicting tendencies - a slow burning of the first
					wave
					and
					accordingly,
					a slow development of an exponential epidemic. However come October, a slow rise
					(exponentially)
					sharply
					speeds up and reaches the maximum in the first dates of December. Which definitely repeats the
					situation in
					Ukraine. However,
					if in Ukraine the epidemic post-peak also heads into decline, then in Russia it stops at
					the plateau.
					In
					December, starts a (currently) slow vaccination campaign.
					<br />
				</p>
				<p class="fst-italic fw-bold text-warning bg-dark">
					First anomaly: The heavy wave should have a sharp inflexion.

				<p class="text-start">
					2. After passing the plateau and before the beginning of the drop, a local hump of cases begins.
					Which continues to correspond with the first peak of the common procedure. Data on the vaccinations
					for the first few months
					are untrustworthy, and after examination, this relationship can easily be considered far-fetched.
					<br />
				</p>
				<p class="fst-italic fw-bold text-warning bg-dark">
					The second anomaly - the correlation between local vaccination procedure peaks with local cases
					peaks.

					3. From the end of December to the middle of January, there is a drop in mortality. This then
					suddenly changes to a
					rise,
					and within
					a week, by the end of January, grows back to December's maximum.
					In spite of this, there is no notable
					difference
					in the cases graph. There is only a small hump a month ago. The difference in
					mortality
					between
					January's minimum and maximum mortality is 15%. At the same time as the relative

					7. June the 8th, suddenly an explosive increase of cases. Literally within a
					week
					after cases, deaths rise to the stratosphere. Even though the normal delay is two times
					more
					- two weeks. I distinctly remember, that exactly during this time there was a fiery campaign
					of propaganda
					of willingly-forced vaccination, under the threat of starvation and poverty, and a cold death.

					12. This argument is not related to Russia, up to the point that Russia shares a border with
					Mongolia. This comes to show as proof, that vaccination in general may be the only
					reason for the epidemic.
					<br />
					In the Asian countries there was very low morbidity (cases), until they started artifically
					infecting
					with the virus. For example, in the peninsula nations of Indo-China or Mongolia. Asians in general
					have a high
					immunity to their local diseases and to the coronavirus especially. An exceptional example
					here
					is Thailand. It is the world's tourists' Mecca, where every year 30 million tourists visit.
					Which is in total only
					half of the total amount of Thais. That is to say, it is impossible to say that there was no
					epidemic in Thailand,
					as if it were closed off from the world and therefore no virus carrier could have
					physically
					sneaked the virus in.
					Not at all. The first and second global waves in Thailand were fied. In the first wave, in
					March-April 2020.
					The amount of cases was around 100 a day and 2-3 deaths. In the second wave, in January
					2021, the new cases were fixed at 200-400, in the first week of February reaching 900.
					Despite this, deaths were almost non-existent, averaging
					0.1-0.9 a day.
					Or in other words, the case fatality rate during the first wave was 2%, and in the second -
					0.2%.
					A twenty-fold drop! That is to say, very similar to the image we see in Western Europe, where the
					case
					fatality rate in the first wave was up to 20%, around 2% during the second wave, also a 20-fold
					decrease.<br />

					Basing on all the facts presented in the video, we can make the same
					graphical
					conclusion about what this all means. We can differentiate the artifical factor from
					the natural one.

				<p class="text-start">

					From the examples of the quick, first European wave and the Ukranian delayed second wave, an
					interpretable expected form
					can be graphed, which should constitute with any natural wave. First, the rise on the left
					corresponds in form
					to the decline on the right. Second, the second wave, unlike the first, has sloping troughs on
					both
					sides, i.e. long periods of ignition and damping.
				</p>

				<p class="text-start">

					On the same height, I took corresponding points on the rise and decline, recorded their
					coordinates,
					which the editor shows, and I saw that the horizontal distance from the rightand left
					between
					the points
					above and below are equal to the pixel, i.e. their angles are equal.
					This means the areas of the troughs must be equal as well.<br />
					This was not the result of trial and error - an exact equal distance truly occured from my first
					attempt. I was
					surprised.

					No. They are not even close to equal. Because at the moment of the screenshots (28 Aug 2021), the
					number of
					injected population was 30%. According to the plan, we need to reach 60%, to
					even out
					with the European 60%. <br />
					The area of the red zone must increase two-fold.

					Yet even if we suppose, that currently there truly is a third wave, which has a natural
					cause and is not the result of the police enforcement of the war against Covid, then in any
					case
					the amount of artifically-inflated deaths does not reach 10% of natural deaths. 10% I
					consider
					the maximally acceptable price, which we can pay for precaution and prophylaxis. When
					the harm from
					the prophylactic measures is equal to the harm from the disease, or even worse - twice as harmful,
					then it no longer
					is a prophylactic. It is a genocide. Pardon my language.

				<p class="text-start">
					Yes, genocide. It doesn't matter in reality, whether it is the result of evil intentions,
					or
					an occurence by monstrofic incompetence by human forces.
					It doesn't matter. What matters is only the
					specific
					amount of deaths. I will remind you that negligence is also written in the criminal code:
				</p>

				<p class="text-start ">
					<span class="fw-bold">Criminal Code of the Russian Federation Article 293. Negligence </span><br />
					<span class="fst-italic">
						3. The act provided for in the first part of this article, entailed by negligence
						death of two or more persons,<br />
						is punishable by compulsory labor for a term of up to five years, with disqualification from
						employment certain
						positions or engage in certain activities for up to three years or without
						or deprivation
						freedom for up to seven years with the deprivation of the right to hold certain positions or
						practice certain
						activities for up to three years or without .</span>
				</p>

				<p class="text-start">
					I however doubt that those who wrote the above statement, when saying "death of two or more persons"
					considered
					something
					on a larger scale than the amount of people to fill a bus, where a drunk mechanic forgot to tighten
					a nut in the
					brakes.
					If negligence became the reason for tens of thousands of deaths, then it has to be called by a
					harsher
					term,
					than simply negligent behaviour to one's societal responsibilities.

		<h1>ConSoc, manifest</h1>

		<div class="block_container">
			<div class="page_block text_block">

				<h2>1. The name - "KonSoc"</h2>
				<p>The general explanation - "Constructor of Social Canon" (a reference to Pereslegin's "construction of
					cultural canon").
					In addition, it is an allusion to Ingsoc, to induce fear of historical memory. Finally,
					a consonant with the word "consortium", which corresponds to the meaning of the Idea.
				</p>

				<h2>2. Economic basis</h2>
				<p>Taxes are being paid willfully. Forcible collection of tribute from the "third estate" is prohibited.
					It is understand,
					that
					salaried workers willingly would not pay their tax money. If they so desire, let it be, but normally
					workers
					are too poor and their cooperation should not be expected. Taxes therefore need to be paid by
					entrepreneurs. For
					entrepreneurs it is normal to pay a large percentage of their profit on their businesses, and for
					personal
					use
					are left with no more than %5. But how does one make them pay, if no one is willing to do so? Well,
					it
					is
					possible, if one understands than entrepreneurs make money off their buyers. When explaining to the
					buyers, that
					they
					can choose who to pay for what.
					When they will see with their own eyes how their money
					is divided, then the "socially responsible" entreprenaurs will survive and thrive, but
					any
					criminal or irrepsonsible trash will end up killing itself. <br>
					In conclusion, strictly according to the joke - "to eat mustard voluntarily and with a song".
				</p>
				<p>
					There are ways of so-called "agitations" that entrepeneurs can be liable to:<br>
					1. Entrepreneurs will release videos of themselves every week, and then buyers will be able to
					view their "Live" and go to those shops, where their boss is more sympathetic towards. The
					more
					that the boss is morally concious, the more he understands his responsibility for everything and
					later can
					make concious decisions regarding where and in what amounts to pay his "governmental services".<br>
					2. Entrepreneurs will in an open and comprehensible manner allow for information dissipation, for
					which
					certain "societal goods" a certian percentage of their proceeds will be spent on. Someone will lean
					on
					sponsoring hospitals. Another will sponsor educational activities. Yet another will
					suddenly
					want to colonice Venus and with his infectious dreaming will be able to infect everyone who can be
					reached via his propaganda.<br>
					3. Entrepreneurs will also be judges, unlimited by any legal framework in the making of sentences.
					However, they will only be able to judge based on Morality, carriers of which they
					themselves
					are. Otherwise, by losing the moral authority, entrepreneurs will be relieved of their
					business, as no one will wish to do business with a crook.<br>
					Nowadays judges are fully and ABSOLUTELY unaccountable to the people. However, when their welath
					becomes
					dependent on their their decisions, here we will find out, how many demons lurked in the shadows for
					centuries.<br>
					<br>
					// The point about entrepreneur-judges - is my personal favourite :) It is also - the most basic
					building block
					of the entire Ideology. Here we have morality, economics, aristocratism and mystics ... Remove
					judgement from Morality
					and everything falls into an incomprehensible mess of disconnected fantasies.
				<p>

				<h2>3. Ethics</h2>
				<p>Base dogmas of the millenia-old historical heritage:<br>
					1. Do not kill,<br>
					2. Do not steal,<br>
					3. Do not give perjury,<br>
					4. Do not bed your close one's wife.<br>
					The result of the French Revolution and democratisation of the last 200 years:<br>
					5. All people are equal in their rights by birth.<br>
					The new institutionalised dogma:<br>
					6. Violent coercion in economics is forbidden.<br>
					<br>
					// 1-5 are clear in their meaning. 6 however is about the point that no one starves to death
					nowadays, hence fools
					can and must be taught by poverty.
				</p>

				<h2>4. Religion</h2>
				<p>Religious text for the aristocracy - "The way of Vantals".<br>
					The main point of the tesis - "you are part of the World and your desires - are the World's desires.
					If you didn't guess,
					what the World needs, then you will be fully punished in justice by Reality.". // Normal religious
					schizophrenia :)
				</p>
				<p>
					My belief:<br>
					For myself I divide 4 levels of sacral reality: My personal angel-tempter, country
					egregor, Soul of Gaia, Law of the Universe. Here is a collection of entities of each level, which
					together
					unite to a single entity of the next level. All together are called Random, because a person
					needs
					a personification of a God. My Random - is simply a reflection of the string of my own reality in
					the
					egregor, to which I belong to.<br>
					Well, and for the masses there will still be Christian Orthodoxy. To each status, their own faith.
				</p>

				<h2>5. Political structure</h2>
				<p>A collection of smaaaall countries of 2-3 million. This number - is the maximum, where people can
					still
					find agreement
					with each other (remember the completely bloodless revolution in 3-million populated Armenia with
					the Belarus
					crap, with a population of 9 million). Then these small country will unite in a group
					because
					it is in everyone's benefit and not because cartels drive slaves under protection of law.<br>
					"Russia" - is not a country. A country with such a name has never existed. "Russia"
					is an egregor :)
				</p>

				<h2>6. The Russian mentality, with their tenacity on the vastness of land</h2>
				<p>
					A group of close countries is an egregor. Like USA, European Union, Russia or China.
					The connectivity of egregor is possible through "natural monopolies", like central bank, railway,
					gas pipelines and
					others, which cross entire territory and they are impossible to break into smaller
					firms,
					in order to compete for their small deals in their local systems. When one singular energy system
					tried to
					divide into micro-firms, s* hit the fan.<br>
					"Natural monopolies" cannot have competitors, that is the definition of a monopoly.
					Therefore competition has to be provided in another, non-economic way. Specifically, in a board
					of directors who are drawn from representatives of each region, to agree on tariffs.
				</p>

				<h2>7. Military defence</h2>
				<p>"The Umbrella Principle", when many small entities organised into a single fist against a common
					enemy.
					If someone goes crazy in some type of Wahhabism and tries to fight his neighbours, then tens of
					other close
					neighbours will organise and will crush the bully via sheer mass.
				<p>

				<h2>8. Propaganda, to whom whatever is closest to heart</h2>
				<p>
					Monarchists - because of aristocracy<br>
					Communists - because of sociality<br>
					Liberals - because of economical freedom and liberty<br>
					Nationalists - because of sharing same spiritual, cultural and moral values between people.<br>
					The Christian Orthodox, Pagans, Buddhists, schizoterics like me - because of spirituality.<br>
					<br>
					I.e. it is an all-inclusive Idea, where everyone will find their right and necessary place.
				</p>

				<h2> 9. Practical agitation </h2>
				<p> The "siloviks", who have sworn to protect the people, actually live by banditry, from the plunder of
					the people. "Siloviks" receive salaries from the state, which collects money from taxes, which, on
					in fact, just a legalized robbery. <br>
					<span class="tw-bold"> Banditry </span> - <span class="tst-italic"> is the taking of money by an
						organized group of persons under threat and / or with the use of armed violence. </span> <br>
					It is not at all clear how legalized "tax collection" differs from banditry. <br>
					<br>
					Concentration camps were also under the law. <br>
					CONCENTRATION CAMPS. SLAVERY. GULAGS. UNIT 731. HUNGERS. WERE. ALSO. BY. THE. LAW.
				</p>

				<h2> 10. Morality and legality </h2>
				<p> More or less homogeneous morality can only be within the boundaries of a 2-3 million community. And
					on borders, where morality changes, "stability" is ensured by interstate agreements, i.e. by laws.
				</p>

				<h2> 11. "How the courts will work under Anarcho-capitalism" </h2>
				<p> 1. It is up to entrepreneurs to judge by their own personal preference and prejudice. Entrepreneurs
					are responsible for their judgment by their own business and reputation. Entrepreneurs do not have a
					legal education, so they will not be able to hide behind volumes of criminal codes. <br>
					2. How the judicial hierarchy will be organized is decided according to local conditions. Somewhere
					the Judge of Last Instance will be elected by popular vote. Somewhere the highest judicial body will
					be the Council of Elders. And somewhere they will live at stake, when, as decided by the gathering
					of the community, then so it will finally be. And the whole crowd will not gather again in this case
					... Everything is very diverse and it is impossible to give a uniform template for the entire
					diversity of cultures. <br>
					For example, I do not know what is going on in the Sharia court. Even more, I don't understand Islam
					at all. Islam for me is some kind of pile of ... mmm ... abstractions? sophisms? aphorisms?
					quatrains? some kind of medieval obscurantism? .. No, I don't understand) <br>

				<h2> 12. "Human rights and freedoms" </h2>
				<p> The guarantee of rights and freedoms must be realized at the physical level. For example, freedom of
					speech is guaranteed by anonymity, not by the schizophrenic law: "You can say everything except what
					is prohibited."
				</p>

				<h2> 13. Education of aristocrats and subjects (subordinates, followers, adherents ...)</h2>

				<p> Buyers with their money express their approval or disapproval of the behavior of aristocratic
					entrepreneurs. Buyers decide who to live and prosper, and who to beg through the crossings, forever
					bearing repentance for their sins. Both their sins and the sins of their parents. </p>

				<h2> 14. Infrastructure Implementation </h2>
				<p> For those who will create clones, copy-paste forks, I recommend paying 0.5% of income to the
					<i>"master node" of the Network</i> /* profit = income - expenses */. Because: <br>
					1. It is necessary to maintain the coherence of the System. The human psyche is geared towards
					hierarchy. Public statements today are worthless, they have completely depreciated and lost
					meaningful meaning, unlike real money transfers. At the UN, all participating countries pay their
					membership and crookedly large-scale wars in the world are not present, when the alliance of some
					countries is against about the same strength of another alliance) <br>
					2. I want Russia to finally receive rewards for all its sufferings, both in the past and the current
					century... <br>
					3. It is a shame that the writer of Capital, who saw the root and essence of capitalism, died in
					poverty and neglect.
				</p>
				<p>
					Well, that's all ... To put it very, very briefly and only the most important things.
